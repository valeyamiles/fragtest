					<p class="story_graf">Rashaad Piper was 8 years old when the state of Louisiana placed him in foster care following reports of abuse at his home. He remembers feeling relieved at the time. He thought he was finally going to be safe, that he was going to be cared for and given a second chance at happiness.</p>
					
					<p class="story_graf">&ldquo;I got tired of getting beat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wanted a better outcome.&rdquo;</p>
					
					<p class="story_graf">He never got that second chance. Piper stayed in the foster system for the next 10 years, cycling through more than a dozen placements, some as far as Ruston in northern Louisiana. Then, on the day of his 18th birthday, as required by law, he aged out of the foster system.&nbsp;</p>
					
					<p class="story_graf">The state had no plan in place for his aftercare. There was no housing or financial assistance to help ease the transition. And though Piper had been diagnosed with a number of mental health disorders for which he was prescribed anti-psychotics, there were no medical follow-ups arranged or therapy appointments scheduled. No one to make sure he took his medications.</p>
					
					<p class="story_graf">There was only one exit strategy: Piper, like many orphaned boys and girls before him, transitioned directly from foster care to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covenanthousenola.org/shelter-documentary/">Covenant House</a>, the homeless shelter on the edge of New Orleans&rsquo; French Quarter.&nbsp;</p>
					
					<p class="story_graf">&ldquo;That was the roughest point of my life,&rdquo; Piper said. &ldquo;I was like an infant trying to make it in the world.&rdquo;</p>
					
					<p class="story_graf">Four years later, Piper is back in state custody as an inmate at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel. In May, he pleaded guilty to two counts of armed robbery for being one of four young men last year who attacked a pair of tourists in New Orleans attending a Unitarian convention.&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="story_graf">Foots is a product of the Desire and Melpomene public housing developments. There are few things capable of unsettling her. And yet, what she experienced that day, and the events that unfolded over the ensuing months, shocked her conscience, she said.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">It wasn&rsquo;t just the crime itself, captured on dramatic surveillance video that stunned even New Orleans and made headlines across the country. It was also what the crime exposed &ndash; widespread failures in a broken Louisiana mental health system that, Foots asserts, is partly responsible for a preventable violent act.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">A review of Paul&rsquo;s UMC medical records by NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune raised significant questions. Four hours after he was admitted, a doctor wrote that Paul was &ldquo;having auditory hallucinations&rdquo; and that he was &ldquo;a potential threat to himself and other people as well as gravely disabled.&rdquo;</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">This assessment gave the hospital a legal right to involuntarily commit Paul for up to three days for observation and treatment, with the possibility of holding him an additional 12 days following a re-examination by the coroner. And yet doctors still chose to discharge him, just one day later.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Behavioral health experts said this is not uncommon, that people in need of psychiatric treatment are released on a regular basis, a result of the state&rsquo;s gutting of its mental health care funding and infrastructure.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">In the past 13 years, the number of psychiatric beds for the indigent in New Orleans shrunk from 100 at the old Charity Hospital to 60 at its replacement, University Medical Center, a 40 percent drop.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">As the number of psychiatric beds decreased, demand exploded. Behavioral health admissions to UMC have increased by 45 percent over the past three years, from 1,585 in 2015 to 2,291 in 2017. This year, the hospital is on pace to have more than 2,400, creating an untenable situation where doctors are forced to triage the mentally ill.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">&ldquo;The lack of beds and investment in mental health care has made the criteria for admission stricter, leaving out more and more people who might need help,&rdquo; said Anne Romig Tucker who served as UMC&rsquo;s director of behavioral health from 2015 to January 2018. &ldquo;People who are gravely disabled and can barely function in society are often discharged.&rdquo;</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">This approach has both human and financial costs. Instead of investing in Paul&rsquo;s mental health care on the front end, the state could now be paying more than triple that amount to incarcerate him for nearly a decade. It costs $31,000 annually to house an inmate with a mental illness compared to treating the person with community health services, which cost about $10,000, according to national statistics from the National Alliance on Mental Illness.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Paul is one of hundreds of homeless kids who cycle through Covenant House and other outreach programs every year, Foots said, many suffering from the same mental health disorders as him, some more severe. If the level of care doesn&rsquo;t improve, and if hospitals continue to turn away people in need because they lack the necessary beds and funding, she fears what happened to Paul and the men he injured could become more commonplace.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">&ldquo;I work with these kids every day and I know they are all very troubled,&rdquo; Foots said. &ldquo;I see their mental illness, but they rarely get the help they need. Just like Dejuan. Those damn voices in his head got ahold of him and he just lost it.&rdquo;</p>

					<p class="story_graf"><strong>When Paul first arrived at&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.covenanthousenola.org/shelter-documentary/"><strong>Covenant House</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;on June 5, 2017,</strong>&nbsp;he didn&rsquo;t tell the staff much about his past or what led him to being homeless, only that he had nowhere else to go.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Foots introduced herself and, as she does with all new residents, laid down the rules: 6 p.m. curfew on weekdays and 8 p.m. on weekends; all bags will be searched; and absolutely no smoking indoors, drinking, inappropriate clothing or threats of violence.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Paul listened, gave Foots a big hug, told her she reminded him of his grandmother and said he loved her.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s this big, tall guy. Really, really nice kid. I would think he was raised by a very good family that gave him very good structure,&rdquo; Foots said. &ldquo;That first day, you don&rsquo;t even notice he has a problem. You really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Ten days later, a boy charged into Foots&rsquo; second-floor office shouting, &ldquo;Miss Foots, you got to come outside! Paul down there circling one of your babies and his eyes rolling behind his head!&rdquo;</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Foots rushed downstairs and into the back courtyard where she found Paul. He was walking around another resident in an &ldquo;aggressive manner,&rdquo; mumbling incoherently as white foam formed at the corners of his mouth.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Foots separated the two boys, then told everyone to clear the area, leaving herself alone with the troubled young man. He said he was hearing voices and he couldn&rsquo;t make them stop. Foots told Paul they needed to get out of the summer heat and walked him inside to the main lobby. Paul became even more agitated. He paced frantically while hitting himself and repeating, over and over again, that he needed his medicine.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Then, as if someone pulled a string, he slumped to the floor near the kitchen.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">Foots knelt down, her face inches from Paul&rsquo;s, and locked eyes with him. She said he needed to focus, that he was in control of his mind, no one else. Ignore the people in your head, she instructed him. Staff members told Foots to keep her distance. She refused.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">She then asked Paul what the voices in his head were saying.</p>
					 
					<p class="story_graf">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna tell you. I don&rsquo;t wanna see. I don&rsquo;t want to hear what they&rsquo;re telling me,&rdquo; Paul said, according to a Covenant House report. He then pulled his hoodie over his head, covering his eyes, and screamed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do it! They&rsquo;re telling me to kill you!</p>
